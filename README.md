Intelligent Algorithms for Optimization of Vehicle Travel

## PART 1
### Safe Adaptive Cruise Control System for simulated Ford Focus

Concept: Develop closed loop control system to control vehicle gas/brake pedals
-> Optimize vehicle speed while maintaining safety

Finalization: Testing scripts developed in MATLAB to run control system in variety of road conditions, and behavioral patterns of lead vehicle
-> We determined optimal set of parameters to control follower vehicle travel

## PART 2
### Intelligent Algorithm for Optimization of Vehicle Travel

Concept: predict future traffic flow at various street intersections, using Graph Neural Network

Development: Deep Learning algorithms GTNN model and LSTM model implemented from scratch, in C++

Testing: Predition accuracy achieved: 95%
