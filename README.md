Intelligent Algorithms for Optimization of Vehicle Travel

## PART 1
### Safe Adaptive Cruise Control System for simulated Ford Focus

Concept: Develop closed loop control system to control vehicle gas/brake pedals

          Optimize vehicle speed while maintaining safety

Finalization: Testing scripts developed in MATLAB to run control system in variety of road conditions, and behavioral patterns of lead vehicle

          We determined optimal set of parameters to control follower vehicle travel

## PART 2
### Intelligent Algorithm for Optimization of Vehicle Travel

Concept: predict traffic flow in future at various street intersections, using Graph Neural Network

Development: Deep Learning algorithms GTNN model and LSTM model implemented from scratch, in C++

Testing: Predition accuracy achieved: 95%
